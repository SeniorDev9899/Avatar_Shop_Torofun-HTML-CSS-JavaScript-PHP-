From the combined strength, technology, and weaponry of the Seven Great Nations come a new breed of warriors that fought against other-worldly enemies to bring the world back from the brink of extinction. Players will need to gear up and customize their armor to their personal playstyle as they fight to prove themselves against other Xandats.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<strong>Game modes:<\/strong><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n- Skirmish - Xandat teams fight in a time-limited skirmish. Each enemy kill will earn points for the team. The first team to reach the appointed Score Value wins. More elaborate take-downs get bonus points. In case of the match reaching the time-limit, the team with the most points win.<br \/>\r\n- Annihilation - Xandat teams face off against each other as they try to wipe the enemy team out in pure weaponized combat. Each team is granted a set number of revives to use in a round. The winner of each round is determined by the last Xandat standing. The overall winner is determined by a race to win 5 rounds during the match.<br \/>\r\n- Corruption - Xandat teams score points by collecting shards dropped by fallen opponents. Enemy points can be denied by collecting dropped shards by team members. Every now and then, an Obelisk will spawn around the map, that when destroyed, will drop multiple shards to collect. The team to reach the goal score or the team with most points by time limit shall win the match.<\/p>","pubdate":"2020-04-01-13-55","pubdate_formatted":"01\/04\/2020 - 13:55","start_at":"","end_at":"","total_like":3,"total_dislike":1,"total_comment":4,"all_comments":{"en":[{"DateTime":"05\/04\/2020 12:40:34,719 02:00","NickName":"robu6","Vote":"2","PlayedTime":"","Text":"MMMMMMM"},{"DateTime":"03\/04\/2020 23:55:33,058 02:00","NickName":"fazaa","Vote":"1","PlayedTime":"","Text":"when we can play the game? and hope there is customs game!."}],"el":[{"DateTime":"08\/04\/2020 10:55:20,231 02:00","NickName":"AijaBlina","Vote":"1","PlayedTime":"","Text":"aijablina968inbox.lv "}],"pt":[{"DateTime":"06\/04\/2020 23:23:36,261 02:00","NickName":"DOMAGOJOMAR","Vote":"1","PlayedTime":"","Text":"OKK AL KAK DA UDZEM"}]},"lang_comments":[{"DateTime":"05\/04\/2020 12:40:34,719 02:00","NickName":"robu6","Vote":"2","PlayedTime":"","Text":"MMMMMMM"},{"DateTime":"03\/04\/2020 23:55:33,058 02:00","NickName":"fazaa","Vote":"1","PlayedTime":"","Text":"when we can play the game? and hope there is customs game!."}],"author":"Mj\u00f6lnir","url":"https:\/\/en.idcgames.com\/project-xandata\/news\/idc-games-announces-the-closed-beta-of-project-xandata-2020-04-01-13-55.html"},{"title":"Weapons: Blast","id":3779,"gamename":"CityBattle | Virtual Earth EU","kind":"Normal","body":"<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/cdn.idcgames.com\/storage\/847\/guard-blast.jpg\" \/><br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe Blast is a minigun that has two different fire modes so that it can be used offensively from different ranges.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe minguns are multi-cannon machine guns with a high rate of fire (thousands of bullets per minute), which employ the rotating cannons Gatling system powered by an electric motor fueled from an external power source.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThis weapon has two shooting modes:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nMode 1 (Left mouse button) -&gt; A moderate rate of fire is used to inflict damage from a wider range.
